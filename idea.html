          <h3>Overview</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                My project will be an illustration-heavy quiz-type program that asks users various questions to determine
                which game(s) they should play next based on a compatibility score. The compatibility score will be based on
                data that will be scraped from a large video game digital distribution service. This ensures that the data
                and games collected will be up-to-date and accurate. After these questions have been answered and the
                probability score has been calculated, the program will recommend the user games based on their results.

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                Searching the web for ‚Äúwhat game should I play next?‚Äù will lead you to countless Reddit posts from people
                seeking to be entertained but feeling overwhelmed with the number of choices out there and outdated online
                quizzes with overly drawn-out, semi-unrelated questions about what books you like to read and hyperbolic,
                pre-written answers that some unpaid intern churned out. Having a program that will consider the user‚Äôs
                individual interests, self-updates as to be accurate, and utilises specific illustrations which are directly
                related to games as to be relevant, eliminates all three pain points people have when searching for
                information. Effectively, giving them up-to-date, tailored results in a pleasant way that‚Äôs both enjoyable
                and fun.

          <h3>Description</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                This product‚Äôs defining feature will be cards in a grid - somewhere between three to twelve, depending on
                the question. Users will be asked a series of questions, one at a time, with various options appearing in
                these cards. Some of the questions that will be asked are about preferred genre, difficulty, gameplay style,
                desired interactivity, popularity, rating, cost, previous experience, amongst others. For instance, if a
                user is asked about which genres they enjoy, they will be given options for strategy, FPS, role-playing,
                sandbox, survival, platformer, etc. These concepts will be distilled into illustrations with minimal text so
                that the user isn‚Äôt overwhelmed. Users can select multiple cards where necessary.
                After all questions have been answered, and the compatibility scores have been calculated, the game with the
                highest score will be recommended prominently. Other games which also score high will also be recommended,
                though less prominently. Users will be able to ‚Äòshow more‚Äô if none of the games interest them, though these
                will have a lower compatibility score. A user will be able to remove games that they‚Äôve already played from
                the list of recommendations, and will be asked if they enjoyed them. This will be on a scale from 1-10, and
                may then affect their recommendations by adding or removing similar games from their list. Games that the
                user has marked as played will go into their library of played games and their scores will be used in future
                compatibility scores.
                The compatibility score will be available for users to see, as will the game‚Äôs technical specifications like
                if it‚Äôs singleplayer/multiplayer, which genres it belongs to, how much it costs and what games it‚Äôs similar
                to based on their played games library. Users will also be given the option to filter their choices more by
                these specifications. For instance, if they want to see only games that are single-player, they will have
                this option. Games will still be displayed in descending order based on their compatibility score.

          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                In addition to a computer, the main technological components of this will be a web scraper, a database, and
                a UI interface. Some of these, such as the web scraper and the database, can be outsourced to third parties
                by using open-source programs. For instance, Scrapy could be used as the web scraper and MySQL for the
                database. However, there is also the potential to develop a web-scraper in-house with languages such as Java
                or Python. It is recommended that the UI interface be developed in house so to have more control over the
                design aesthetics, details, branding, and overall experience. This then ties into the illustrations, which
                will likely be completed in Adobe Illustrator, or a similar program.

          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                There are three main technological components to this project, the database, the web scraper, and the UI
                interface. These each require different skill sets, talents, and languages. To use the database, SQL will be
                required. To write the web scraper, a language like Python or Java will likely be used. To write the UI
                interface, a mix of basic web knowledge and more specific web-based technologies will be needed. A designer
                may use a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS. This
                project is reasonably feasible because the skills required don‚Äôt necessarily need to be at the expert-level,
                so much as they require beginner to intermediate skill, time, and research. Failing to find parties with
                each different skill set, third-party programs can be supplemented, and the remaining components can be
                worked on collaboratively. However, this project also requires an illustrator to make the card illustrations
                and an algorithm developer to develop the weighting system/algorithm for the compatibility score. Both of
                these professions require technical skill, and although they can be completed by someone less experienced,
                the results will likely be inferior. If an inferior algorithm is created, the product may not work as
                intended. If inferior illustrations are made, a user might not use the product to begin with. Unfortunately,
                these are skills which require a lot of time and study to develop, and as a result, may be harder to
                acquire.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                If this project is successful, there will be a self-updating resource people can use to find games relevant
                to them specifically that is pleasant and simplistic to use. It will close a gap in the market and alleviate
                the need to search for pre-written listicles of generic top-ten lists that cater to the masses and will be
                out-dated by the time they find it anyway. Although this program will be released for free, it may prove
                financially viable through donations, advertising, data collection, and other less conventional means of
                commercial success.
