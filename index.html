            My name is Jennifer and I’m a Scottish-Australian ESL teacher who only speaks English, despite years of
            trying. I also have five formal qualifications at twenty-two, so I’m either really good or really bad at time
            management. One cert IV, three diplomas and a bachy, in case you were wondering. Although I have spent many
            months in language classrooms, previously for Korean and currently for Polish, I can only communicate like a
            developmentally-delayed five-year-old. Something I also do in English, but at least at my own volition. I
            have one cat, he is named Fatty. No prizes for guessing why. (He also responds to Chonky and Chonkers). <br><br>
