        <h2> Results </h2>

        <p>
            Taking these tests at face value, and assuming that they’re valid, worthy of consideration,
            and provide some insight into a person’s mind, there are a couple of things we can gleem about me.
        </p>

        <h3> Myers–Briggs Type Indicator </h3>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img src="MyersBriggsPersonalityResults.PNG" alt="MyersBriggsPersonalityResults" width="100%" height="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
            Firstly, looking at the Myers-Briggs’ test, some of my positive characteristics are that I am, or at least
            can be, rational, informed, independent, determined, curious and versatile. I tend to seek out information,
            try to
            expand my knowledge, base my opinions on facts, as opposed to feelings, don’t rely on others, work hard to
            achieve my
            goals, explore new ideas, and am willing to try many things in order to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            For obvious reasons, these traits can be helpful when trying to complete a task, and as such have proved
            helpful in a work or school based setting. That is, of course, until they go unchecked and become the
            extreme,
            undesirable versions of themselves. Confidence becomes arrogance, independence becomes dismissiveness, or
            inability to
            work with others, and flexible becomes labile. Because I tend to be evidence-based, if I find myself in a
            position where I am asked to do something without a good explanation of why, I can come off as combative and
            questioning of authority.
        </p>

        <h3>VARK</h3>
        <div class="imageContainer">
            <img src="varkQuestionnaireResults.PNG" alt="varkQuestionnaireResults" width="100%" height="100%">
        </div>
        <p>
          I didn’t find the VARK questionnaire particularly useful because my immediate thought with almost all
            questions was “well, it depends”. Then when I read the options, I selected all of them, most of the time.
            The questionnaire really struck me
            as a “would you like more information or less information?”, as opposed to “which information would you
            like?”
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, when given the prompt: “When learning from the Internet I like: <br><br>

            A) Videos showing how to do or make things.<br>
            B) Audio channels where I can listen to podcasts or interviews.<br>
            C) Interesting written descriptions, lists and explanations.<br>
            D) Interesting design and visual features”.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            All I could think of is “well, it depends, but ‘yes’”. <br><br>

            I also noticed that a lot of the questions were targeted for beginners, or people doing things for the first
            time. I think a beginner, an intermediate, and an expert, would benefit from different types of explanations
            based
            on their experience level more so than their learning style. And this is without even mentioning that
            different
            topics can be explained better/easier with certain styles.
        </p>

        <h3>Big Five</h3>
        <div class="verticalImageContainer">
            <img src="BigFivePersonalityResults.PNG" alt="igFivePersonalityResults" width="100%" height="100%">
        </div>

        <p>
            My Big Five personality score revealed that I’m slightly more introverted than I am extroverted, which I
            would agree with. Not necessarily because I don’t like socialising or that I’m not good at it, but I find it
            can be quite draining and it’s not where I get my energy from. I tend to socialise in small bouts, then go off
            on my own to recharge.
            It also revealed that I’m a reasonably emotionally stable person who can handle stress and is slow to anger
            and other negative emotions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The test believes I’m slightly more agreeable than disagreeable, which I would agree with in everyday life -
            I’m more than happy to go with what the other person wants for things like where we should eat, or what we
            should watch (things I consider mostly unimportant) - but not when it comes to important things, like work or
            assessments. In those cases, I think we should do what will result in the most desirable outcome, or most
            promising idea.

            Which, I can acknowledge, is not always mine, though I won’t easily acquiesce if I think mine is better.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a highly conscientious person who’s disciplined and well organised. I tend to implement structures,
            timelines, to-do lists, and other time and progress trackers to keep on top of my tasks. I like to produce
            good work on time.
        </p>

        <p>
            I scored roughly 50/50 on intellect/Imagination (previously known as openness to experience) which surprised
            me slightly. Though, if considered from the perspective that I neither seek out the traditional/the
            expected/the usual, or the new/the untested/the unusual, I would agree. I don’t inherently go for either extreme,
            despite being open to both of them, depending on the context and specific scenario.
        </p>

        <h3> Working in a team </h3>
        <p>
            I can imagine these results will influence my behaviour in the following ways:
            I will likely get together with my team during our first meeting, where we will discuss our goals,
            strengths, weaknesses, and the project idea. I will genuinely be open to everyone’s ideas (versatile). I
            will make my arguments for why I am best suited to a specific role (rational, determined). We will then go our
            separate ways and I will complete my tasks alone (independance).
            I will go to all of our scheduled meetings (conscientiousness), but avoid unnecessary socialising outside of
            what is required for the assessment (introversion). During our meetings, I will take all notes given about
            my work seriously, and will try to open up a line of dialogue to determine the best course of action - fully
            accepting and welcoming the possibility that I am wrong, but also arguing why I believe I am right (rational, flexible).
        </p>

        <h3> Finding a team </h3>
        <p>
            Ideally, every group will have members who complement each other and harmonise together. As a generic
            overview, a good team might have a healthy mix of technical proficiency, both front and back end, regular
            and informative communication, both internal and external, as well as some sort of management system to keep track of
            progress. Whether or not each member has one task that they stick to that best compliments their skillset, or it’s a more
            free-for-all sort of deal where everyone chips in everywhere will depend on the team and their dynamics. I think because I
            am personally quite a structured person and independent person,having my own task that I work on as an individual is
            better suited to my strengths.
