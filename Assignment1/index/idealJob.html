        <h3>
            The job
        </h3>
            <p>My ideal job right now would be a junior backend dev. This position at Scientific Games is for a junior backend developer 
                at a gambling company in their R&D department. They’re a company who makes scratchies, slot machines, and electronic table games. 
                This job appeals to me because I find the psychology behind gambling to be interesting, and believe it provides a fun outlet 
                for adults, whilst also acknowledging it, like most things, can be abused. I’d like to learn how this is managed from the 
                production side of things and what mitigation tactics they use to diminish it.

        <h3>
            The skills they want
        </h3>
            <p>This position requires the candidate to design and develop gaming products. They’re required to design 
                the function and requirement specifications, as well as the system and module design documentation. 
                They’re required to do unit testing, load testing, and test for error conditions. They may be required to 
                investigate and fix field issues and they must also develop unit testing tools. Their ideal candidate would 
                have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field. They’d have experience 
                in C++ and C, 1+ years’ experience in a software development team, knowledge of embedded software development, 
                and experience with Visual Studio and Windows programming. 
            </p>

        <h3>
            The skills I have
        </h3>
            <p>I’m broadly-educated with many formal qualifications in fields such as business, graphic design, 
                TESOL, and communications. I’ve been self-studying programming for a few months using guided materials 
                like Harvard’s CS50. This has mainly been in C, though with some supplementary languages like Python 
                and SQL. Because of my background in C, I have a better understanding of how many things happen “under the hood”. 
                I have successfully implemented data structures such as trie trees in problem sets. One instance of this was 
                when I created a spell checker, which required the use of memory allocation and pointers in order to quickly 
                and efficiently determine which words in a given file were correctly spelled.

        <h3>
            The plan
        </h3>
            <p>
                Though their job specifies that a successful candidate will have a computer science or related degree, 
                I have seen many a person get a developer job that have required this, despite not possessing one themselves. 
                I see this more as a barrier to overcome, but which can be hurled by other means besides a new four-year degree. 
                After all, whether or not you have a piece of paper doesn’t impact your ability to write effective and elegant 
                code. My plan is to become competent enough to get an entry-level job through a mix of self-study, through YouTube, 
                trial and error, online articles, guided-study, like various universities open courses,  and formal study, like RMIT, 
                and then leveraging that experience to get higher-level, higher-paying jobs.
