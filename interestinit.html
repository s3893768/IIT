          <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
            <article>
              <p>
                  My interest in IT lies in being able to make things and solve problems.
                  I want to be able to automate various mundane tasks in my life as much
                  as I possibly can, and create/alter things to be better suited to me as
                  an individual. I realize this is a skill set I do not currently possess,
                  and understand it will require a lot of time and effort to be able to achieve it.
                  Nevertheless, I am persistent, and if the cost of slightly improving my technological
                  quality of life is months upon months of tedious, difficult, or time consuming work then so be it!

        <h3>The spark</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
                My interest in programming started about a year ago, mainly when I met people who knew how to do it.
                I saw that they were able to do things I could not, and, as all good motivators do, it irked and inspired
                me.
                Since then, I’ve dabbled here and there in various things for beginner programmers, such as Harvard’s CS50
                (which I highly recommend). Other than that, I’d say I’ve always had a soft or general interest in IT,
                mainly just because I’ve been an avid internet-user since the age of twelve or so. Plus, I figured it was about
                time I added another formal qualification to the list.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
                My experience in IT is very limited in breadth, sans the previously mentioned CS50. However, during the course, I
                went from my first ‘Hello World’ to dealing with data structures such as trie-trees and other higher-level concepts.
                The course was mainly taught in C, with brief forays in Python and SQL. This is roughly the extent of my IT experience,
                with bits and bobs of just inherent learning through internet usage thrown in.

        <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
          <article>
              <p>
                  I chose RMIT because, in short, after considering it against its competitors, it was the most desirable
                  option. There were two other universities I was considering, and although they were good, they weren’t
                  the best (for me).
                  My process was as follows: I made a Gantt chart considering class duration, gaps between classes, and
                  prerequisites for future classes. This gave me a better idea of what 3-months-from-now me could expect to be doing.
                  I compared the language taught and concepts covered by the various universities, considering my previous
                  experience and the gaps in my knowledge. I also considered less tangible factors like branding, name recognition, and
                  prestige. RMIT won.

        <h3>Learning expectations</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
                The question “what do you expect to learn during your studies” is, in a way, a bit nebulous.
                Purposefully so, I imagine. If ‘studies’ is referring to one specific class, like Intro to Programming
                or Intro to IT, then, I suppose… the basics? If we’re taking a step further back and considering a whole
                degree then enough to make me roughly average with the other degree holders. If we’re going even further
                back and just considering all studying in general, I think we’ve found the reason for the question, to
                which I would reply, “I’ll learn about as much as I try to”.

                I remember during my first degree, I tried exceptionally hard, studied for countless hours each night, went
                to every tute, wrote and rewrote every assignment, all in a bid to get a high GPA, but what I noticed was
                that my friends who did none of these things got the same piece of paper as I did in the end. I think what
                I learned was it’s pretty easy to skate by doing the bare minimum with many things, and you’ll probably
                even get your piece of paper, too, but if you actually want to learn, understand, and be better, you usually
                need to go above and beyond.
